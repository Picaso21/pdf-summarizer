st.markdown("# PDF summarization using Pegasus")
st.markdown(
  '''PhD scholars are often tasked with reading a Scientifc paper and producing a short summary of it to demonstrate both reading 
  comprehension and writing ability. This is called abstractive summarization where summaries are based on understanding of the whole 
  passage and ability to rephrase it and this is one of the most difficult task in NLP. It was not until the development of techniques 
  like seq2seq learning and unsupervised language models (e.g., ELMo and BERT) that abstractive summarization becomes more feasible.
Building upon earlier breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) field, Googleâ€™s [PEGASUS](%s) further improved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 
results for abstractive summarization, in particular with low resources. To be more specific, unlike previous models, PEGASUS enables us to achieve
 close to SOTA results with 1,000 examples, rather than tens of thousands of training data. The model uses Transformers Encoder-Decoder architecture. 
 The encoder outputs masked tokens while the decoder 
  generates Gap sentences. ''' %url_pegasus)
